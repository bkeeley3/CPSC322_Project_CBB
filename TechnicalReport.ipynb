    "The dataset we decided to use for our project is a college basketball dataset from 2013-2019. The dataset has everywhere from basic attributes such as games won and games played, to very advanced statistics such as two-point-percentage allowed and adjusted defensive efficiency. The dataset is highly usable, with no noisy or incomplete data.\n",

    "In total, there are 24 attributes, however, we are planning on using 13 of those attributes. The attribute that we are planning on trying to predict is whether or not a team will be above a .500 win percentage. This attribute is not explicitly in the dataset, however, we are planning on calculating the win percentage for each team ourselves, then making a new column that will store a boolean value on if the team was above .500 or not. In the future, we way drop the games and games win columns altogether once we have this column, but for now, we are going to keep it in. The attributes we plan on using to calculate if a team would be above or below .500 or not are... \n",
