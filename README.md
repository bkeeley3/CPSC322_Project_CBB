# **College Basketball Above or Below .500 Classifier**
This repository is for our CPSC 322: Data Science Algorithms course a final project. In this project, our goal is to measure different classifiers performances on whether or not a college basketball team with achieve a winning record or not. This is done without the use of relavent libraries such as skLearn or Pandas as per the requirements of our course, so our classifiers are made by us and are located in our mySklearn folder. The dataset we are using contains relavent statistics to from Division 1 basketball teams from the years 2013 - 2021. In total, there are 23 attributes, but we decided to select 9 key ones we thought would be the best at predicing performance. You can read more inside of our project in the Project Proposal Juypter Notebook, where we outline our goals for the project. In our Technical Report Jupyter Notebook, you will find our results of our classifiers we used, along with other insights and visualizations about the data. To run these documents, all you need is Python version 3.9.12. Because we created our notebooks in a specific Docker container, we have certain libraries we were constricted in what we could use per requirements of our course.
